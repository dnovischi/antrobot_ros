-- This file contains the configuration for Cartographer in a 2D setup. In this
-- configuration, odometry is provided externally by wheel encoders or ICP
-- (Iterative Closest Point) or a combination. Both Cartographer's SLAM
-- front-end and back-end are utilized to provide accurate mapping and
-- localization. The front-end handles sensor data processing and pose
-- estimation, including scan matching, while the back-end optimizes the pose
-- graph for loop closure. We use Cartographer for the full SLAM process here,
-- leveraging its capabilities for both scan matching and loop closure.
